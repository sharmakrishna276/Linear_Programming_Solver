# Running the Linear Programming Problem (LPP) Solver Tester

## Overview
This document provides instructions for running the Linear Programming Problem (LPP) Solver Tester. The tester is designed to generate test cases, solve them using a linear programming solver, and compare the obtained solution with the expected solution.

## Instructions

1. **Generate Test Case and Commands Files:**
   - Run the `tester.py` script in your terminal:
     ```
     python tester.py > commands.txt
     ```
   - This command generates a test case in the `input.txt` file according to the specified format in the assignment. Additionally, it records the processing steps performed by the LPP solver in the `commands.txt` file.

2. **Run Your Solver Script:**
   - Modify your solver script to read the test case from `input.txt` and generate the solution in the required format.
   - Execute your solver script, which should generate an `my_output.txt` file containing the solution status and optimal value (if the solution status is optimal).

3. **Run the Comparison Script:**
   - Run the `test_later.py` script:
     ```
     python test_later.py
     ```
   - This script generates an `answer.txt` file based on the expected solution and compares it with the `my_output.txt` file generated by your solver script.
   - If both files match, it indicates that your solver script produced the expected solution.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that you have installed the necessary Python modules, such as PuLP, before running the scripts.
- Modify your solver script to adhere to the specified output format (`my_output.txt`) to ensure accurate comparison results.
